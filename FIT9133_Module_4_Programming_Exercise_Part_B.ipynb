        "The theory of **searching** is at the centre of database and data research. Searching allows for the _retrieval_ of useful data and for its organisation, most namely in the form of **sorting**. We start with searching because it leads directly to applications of sorting. \n",
        "\n",
        "The theory of basic searching is simple: **Linear Search** finds items by probing one item at a time in the order that they appear in the list until the desired element is found, or the end of the list is reached. The second search that was discussed is **Binary Search**, which suggests that if we probe for an item, we can know what we are looking for (if it exists) will be either the current item that we are looking at, or lies on the left or right of that item.\n",
        "\n",
        "It can be seen is that Linear Search is universal. If the element exists in the list being searched then it will be found, irrelevant of how the list is constructed. For Binary Search to work the list must be sorted. Starting at the centre (or close to the centre) of the list, the probing can be done with a more efficient procedure.\n",

There are many arguments on the topic that are usually based around the length of the list, and the number of times an item is to be searched for. Discuss it on the forums."
