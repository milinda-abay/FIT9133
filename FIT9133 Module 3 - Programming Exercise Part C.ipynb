In an environment where multiple agents are trying to solve a problem, some parts of the code become critical. \n",

Therefore, the critical section of the code should allow only one agent at a time to manipulate the variables. All other agents should wait. One way of achieving this is by implementing a queue.\n",

    "Based on the Queue ADT defined in Alexandria, write a class **Master** that controls the access of multiple agents in the critical section. The class will maintain a queue to keep track of agents waiting for the resource. It will have a **enter** function which will be used by agents to gain entry in the critical region and an **exit** function once they are exiting the critical region. \n",
    "\n",
