    "This first part of the programming activity explores the concept of **file handling**, in particular the operations of reading and writing files. The exercises below will require you to read some data from a file, manipulate it and write it back to the file. Comments have been added where necessary to assist you with the program development.\n"

For example,  one such entry is \"1 2 five\". Your task is to read in the data; and if a number is written as a string, convert it to a number written as digits. For example after the manipulation, the output will be \"1 2 5\" for the given example. Write the result back into a file named `output_file.txt`.\n",
